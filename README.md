### INTRODUCTION
The Ghanaian Professionals in France (GPF) Association is created to connect and assist Ghanaian professionals living in France by providing personal and professional development opportunities. It does this through various activities such as networking, mentorship, and investment.

GPF is committed to providing a safe and welcoming environment for all participants, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, religion, socio-economic background, or any other personal characteristic.

This document covers the code of conduct applicable to all members, representatives, executives, and any other individual who enters into a relationship or collaboration with the association (attendees, speakers, sponsors, volunteers, organizers, etc.). It also applies during functions related to the association such as (but not limited to) meetings, conferences, social events, and celebrations.

It stands beside but does not exclude or replace the rights and obligations under common and statute law.



### 2. Code of Conduct 
Members, representatives, executives, and any other individual in relation to the association are expected to:
* Act with care and diligence in fulfilling the obligations of their position;
* Treat all members and affiliates of GPF with courtesy and respect, and avoid any kind of harassment;
* Behave honestly and with integrity in relation to their role in the association;
* Not discriminate on the basis of irrelevant characteristics such as sex/gender, tribe, race, religious or political attachment, disability, age, marital status, sexual orientation or other protected characteristics set out by law;
* Comply with any lawful and reasonable direction given by someone in the Association who has the authority to do so;
* Maintain appropriate confidentiality about official dealings that they have  with any member of staff or confidential information of the Association;
* Take reasonable steps to avoid any conflict of interest (real or apparent) and disclose reasonable details should such a situation arise details of any personal interest of the person in connection with their role;
* Use resources of the association in a proper manner and for the intended purpose(s); 
* Not inappropriately use inside information, status, power, or authority in connection with the association: 
* To obtain or seek to obtain, a benefit for themselves or any other person; 
* To cause or seek to cause detriment to the association or another individual or organization. 







### 2.1 Resolving issues of concern under the Code of Conduct 
The following steps are to be taken when attempting to resolve concerns related to conduct. It should be noted that minor or isolated violations of the Code may not warrant action. However, serious isolated instances that form a pattern of behavior may be viewed more seriously. 

**Step 1**: As a general principle, and wherever it is possible to do so, attempts should be made to resolve issues at an individual level. This means that direct discussions between the concerned persons should take place, with the matter being escalated to the appropriate level only when necessary. For the latter, discussions should be held with the President/Vice-president of the association.

**Step 2**: The relevant authority (President/Vice-president) shall assess the situation to determine the best course of action to follow. This could involve dealing with the matter directly or choosing to engage other executives or relevant individuals or institutions.



### 2.2 Association Executives

In addition to the principles outlined above, there are some expectations and responsibilities that extend to the Association’s executive members and elected officials. These are detailed below:

* To be present at all executive and general meetings/functions, unless there is appropriate justification for absence. In the event of absence, the executive is expected to bring themselves up to speed on information that was missed. This should typically be available in the Minutes of Meeting (MoM). For all functions, and more specifically executive meetings, the agreed-upon acceptable number of absences and associated disciplinary action should be respected.
* To dutifully fulfill the responsibilities detailed under the role that they occupy.
* To take reasonable steps to ensure the association runs smoothly and successfully. This includes suggestions for improvement of how things are run.
* To make clear to the President/Vice-president- or other executives, when necessary- if they are no longer willing to serve in the position of executive. In such a case, one is allowed to reserve the details of their reasons for retiring from the post.
* To accord all other members the necessary respect attached to the office/role/capacity/position occupied and present a united front as a body of executives.
* To maintain a high level of confidentiality where necessary, especially within the executive body.
* To understand and help other members to understand that the application of principles is ultimately to help establish a workable system for the association, not for settling personal scores.
* To apply the funds and resources of the association for the purposes of the association.


### 3. Breach of Code 
Any action that may be in violation of this Code will be given full and impartial consideration. If indeed an infraction is identified, suitable action may be taken.

[^1]: This should be spelled out in the association’s Constitution, which will describe the measures for ‘disciplinary’ action.
